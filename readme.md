App is deployed in docker container in virtual private server.

#### Frameworks and libraries:

- [Flask] - Micro web framework written in python.
- [Flask-Socketio](https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Flask-SocketIO gives Flask applications access to low latency bi-directional communications between the clients and the server.
- [Flask-login] - Flask-Login provides user session management for Flask.
